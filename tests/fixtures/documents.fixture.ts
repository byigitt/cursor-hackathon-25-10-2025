      Chapter 1: The Scientific Method
      
      The scientific method is a systematic approach to understanding the natural world through observation and experimentation.
      
      Key Steps:
      1. Observation: Identifying phenomena or problems
      2. Question: Formulating specific questions about observations
      3. Hypothesis: Proposing testable explanations
      4. Experiment: Testing the hypothesis through controlled studies
      5. Analysis: Examining data and drawing conclusions
      6. Communication: Sharing results with the scientific community
      
      Important Concepts:
      - Variables: Independent (manipulated) and dependent (measured)
      - Control groups: Baseline for comparison
      - Reproducibility: Results must be repeatable
      - Peer review: Validation by other scientists
      
      Chapter 2: Cell Biology
      
      Cells are the fundamental units of life. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.
      
      Types of Cells:
      - Prokaryotic: No nucleus, simpler structure (bacteria)
      - Eukaryotic: Has nucleus, complex organelles (plants, animals, fungi)
      
      Key Organelles:
      - Nucleus: Contains genetic material (DNA)
      - Mitochondria: Powerhouse of the cell, produces ATP
      - Ribosomes: Protein synthesis
      - Endoplasmic Reticulum: Protein and lipid processing
      - Golgi Apparatus: Packaging and shipping proteins

      Algebra Basics
      
      Variables and Expressions:
      - Variables represent unknown values (x, y, z)
      - Expressions combine variables and numbers
      - Terms: parts separated by + or - signs
      - Coefficients: numbers multiplying variables
      
      Solving Equations:
      1. One-step equations: x + 5 = 12
      2. Two-step equations: 2x + 3 = 15
      3. Multi-step equations: 3(x + 2) - 4 = 11
      
      Key Properties:
      - Distributive: a(b + c) = ab + ac
      - Commutative: a + b = b + a, ab = ba
      - Associative: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
      - Identity: a + 0 = a, a × 1 = a
      
      Geometry Fundamentals:
      
      Basic Shapes:
      - Triangle: 3 sides, angles sum to 180°
      - Square: 4 equal sides, 4 right angles
      - Circle: all points equidistant from center
      
      Formulas:
      - Rectangle area: A = length × width
      - Triangle area: A = (1/2) × base × height
      - Circle area: A = πr²
      - Circle circumference: C = 2πr
