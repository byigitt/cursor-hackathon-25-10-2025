## Integration Points

### tRPC Queries & Mutations
1. **Quiz Data:**
   - `api.quiz.getById.useQuery({ id: quizId })`
   - Fetches quiz questions without revealing correct answers

2. **Submit Quiz:**
   - `api.quizAttempt.submit.useMutation()`
   - Submits answers and receives score
   - Automatically navigates to results

3. **Results Data:**
   - `api.quizAttempt.getById.useQuery({ id: attemptId })`
   - Fetches detailed results with correct/incorrect breakdown

4. **Deck List:**
   - `api.deck.getMyDecks.useQuery()`
   - Lists all user decks for quiz overview

5. **Attempt History:**
   - `api.quizAttempt.getMyAttempts.useQuery({})`
   - Retrieves user's quiz attempt history

### Navigation Flow
```
/dashboard/quizzes
  └─ [quizId]
      ├─ Take quiz (question by question)
      └─ Submit → Navigate to results
          └─ [attemptId]
              ├─ View detailed results
              ├─ Retake quiz (back to [quizId])
              └─ Return home
```
